Super keyword:
is used to refer to the perent class object;
why should we learn keyword;

IF WE HAVE same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we
can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because
by default java prefer the variable of child class.We can also call the super class
constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super();

How to use super keyword:
we can use super.name or field name to call the method or to access the field of super class
2. use the super with () to call the super class constructor


rules
we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or fields or method with the help
of super keyword
2. we can only use super with () inside a constructor;
3. if we have a  user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor
inside the child classes as well.
4.super with () should be the first line inside a constructor

MethodOverloading
when same name method exist in a class but with different number of paramiters or
different type of paramiters or different sequence of parameters
it is called methodOverloading

Why we should use:
1. make you code more readable;
2. makes the life of the end users easy they don't have to memorize many method name

How we can use method:
we can have same name methods but we have to follow the below rules.
1. by passing different number of parameters;
2.we can change the data type of parameters.
3.we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.
