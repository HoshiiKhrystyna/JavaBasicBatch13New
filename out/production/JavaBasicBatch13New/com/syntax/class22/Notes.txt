MethodOverloading in java
with the help of method overloading we can have many method with same name but different
parameters in a class
Why we should use method overloading:
1. cleaner code, if multiple methods are doing the same name we don't need
to came up wyth different name
2.flexibility for the end user

How we can use :
we can overload a method by changing 3 things:
1.number of parameters;
2.change the data types of parameters
3.we can change the sequence of ();

class Calculator{
int method(int num1, int num2){
return num1+num2;
}
}
int method(int num1, int num2, int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}
}
Rules:
1. method name should be same, but parameters should be different
2.we can't overload a method by just changing its return type
3. we can also overload constructor by following the same rules;
===============================================================
Overriding method

Happens when same method exist inside the parent class and child class.
Why:
if we are inheriting from Parent class and we don't like the implementation
of a method from the parent class we can provide our own implementetion
Sometimes it's done to improve the performance of code.
How we can override a method:
when we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside
the child class.All should be same expect the body and access modifiers


Rules:
1. for Override we must inherit from a class.
2. the method in the parent class that want to override must be exactly the same
as method in the child class
3. the access modifier in the child class can only be increased with respect
to the visibility for example we can change default to protected
or to public, but we can not make it private
4. if something is not inherited we can't override it for example private
method and constructor.
