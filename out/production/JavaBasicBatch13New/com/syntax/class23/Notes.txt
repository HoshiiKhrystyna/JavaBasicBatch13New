What is method overriding
when same method with same header exists in the child class as well.
Why we should override:
if we inherit from a class all method which are not private they are inherited in the child
class.
if we don't like some of this method may because they consume(spozyvaty) more internet
badwidth(pohana shyryna spozyvannya) of consume a lot of CPU or uses a lot of memory
we can override them in the child class
How can we use ovverride:
1. we must first inherit from a class.
 2. we can redeclare the method with same header(zaholovok) and provide the body of our choice

Rules:
1. we must have a super class  derived class relationship(pohidni clasovi vidnosyny)
2.method in the parent and child class must have header but they can be different
in term of access and in very rear condition in term of return
type;
3.we can't change the access modifier from public to protected or default but we can do
it in reverse order
4. we can't override constructor because they are also not inherited.
5. if a method is static we used a different terminology its called method redeclaration
instead of overriding.
