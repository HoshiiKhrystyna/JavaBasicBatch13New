What is a List:
List is an interface inside the collections framework which have below properties
1) Insertion order(poryadok vstavky)  is maintained.(zberihayetsya)
2)I can store duplicate data;
List is implemented by many classes, but we will be focusing on ArrayList and
LinkedList:
ArrayList:
when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then
i should going with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
Most of operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start
or shifting the data we should be going with LinkedList.
Iterator:
is an interface that has three methods hasNext() and remove()
whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop
there are chance that it will not work or will through an error because
lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime, so to be always on the safe
side we should use Iterator.
===================================================================
Set:
1.duplicates are not allowed
We wiil be disscussing three types of sets:
1.HashSet   2.LinkedHashSet; 3.TreeSet
HashSet:
No insertion order is maintained but it is the fastest of all;
LinkedHashSet:
insertion order
==========================================================
Map
Map is an interface in java that allow us store key value pairs
we can't have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values .
We will

HashMap:
