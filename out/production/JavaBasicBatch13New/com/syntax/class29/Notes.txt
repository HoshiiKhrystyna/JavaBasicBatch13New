Set:
Set in java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types
of sets but we will  only discuss the most widely used ones which
are
1. HashSet.2.LinkedHashSet3.TreeSet
HashSet:
Upside:
Most commonly used typeof set it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve
the data.
Downside:
Insertion order is not maintained
No get method to get a single value
LinkedHashset:
Upside:
Insertion order is maintained
Downside:insertion speed is comparable to HashSet but the retrieval
speed is the slowest.
TreeSet:
Upside:The Data is stored in the sorted form
Dowmside:insertion speed is slow.Retrieval speed is better than
linkedHashSet, but slower than Hashset.
Notes:Mostly used to remove duplicates
================================================================
Map:
Allow to store key value pairs.first Entry is treated as key and the second
one is treated as value. Keys can't be duplicate but value can be.
Map<Integer,String>items=new HashMap<>();
There are many types of maps as sets, but we will only discuss 3 of them.
1.HashMap 2. LinkedHashMap;3.TreeMap;
HashMap:
it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data.
Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
LinkedHashMap:
Upside: insertion order is maintained.
Downside: insertion speed slower than HashMap retrival speed is slowest of ALL.
TreeSet:
Upside: data is stored in stored form always.
Downside: insertion speed is very slow.

Choose proper DataStructure.
i want to store unique names in the sorted form:treeSet
i want to store the names of the students and most of the time I wiil be
performing operations related to data retrieval based on index:arrayList
item names and prices and maintained insertion order:LinkedHashMap
