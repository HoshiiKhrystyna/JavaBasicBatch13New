3 tipes variables in java:
local, instance, static

local:
the variables that we declared inside a block of code
upSide: they occupy the memory for shortest period of time
downSide: they can't be accessed outside that block of code in which they are declared

Instance:
are the variables that are declared inside a class, but outside a block of code;
upSide: can be accessed in all the methods of a class. they  can have different values for each instance of a class
d
Static:
all the variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword they
are called static variables

upside:
they only reserve a single memory location for all the instances of a class
they can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name;
downside: the occupy th e memory for longest period of the time they always store
only one value
real lifee used
Most of the time you will be storing constant value in static variables
static is also used with method that don't involve instance variables

Access modifiers: there are 3 access modifier keywords (privat, protected,public)and 4 access levels(private
public,protected,default) in java
rules:

access modifiers can used only with instance and staticmembers of class(fields
and methods)
private:
when we use private with any methods or variables we can only access that method or
variables in that class
real life use: 99% instance fields are always private;
methods are public;


default is not a keyword;
we can access that member inside the same class inside the same package in other classes
public: whe we use public with members of a class is aviable throughout that project.
