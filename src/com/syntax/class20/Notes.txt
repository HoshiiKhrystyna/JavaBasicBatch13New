Inheritance

is a mechanism in java through which one class aquires the properties and methods
inside another class, it is one of the main four pillars of OOP
Why we should use:
1. it helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write .
2. it is more efficient
3. save memory
How we can use Inheritance:
we can use extends keyword after the class name and then the name of the class from which we want
to inherit the code.
Example is given below.

class Parent{
String name="Pavlo";
String eyeColor="green";
}
class Child extends Parent{

public void printInfo(){
Sout (name+""+eyeColor);
}
}

Types of inharitance:
Different languages support different types of inheritances but 5 are very common
1. single;
2.multilevel;
3.hierarchial
4. multiple-can't use in java
5.hybrid

1.Single:
single parent class and single child class;
Class A<-ClassB
2. multilevel:
one from another: grandparent-parent=child-grandchild
Class A<-ClassB<-ClassC
3.Hierarchial :
one single parent and more then one childs classes;
Clas A
/|
classB classC
