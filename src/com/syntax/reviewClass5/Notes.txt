Method Overriding:
When same method exists in parent and child class
Why we should use:
Same method can behave differently on different objects. It allows
us to achieve polimorphism
What is the syntax to achieve method overriding:
Redefine the method with same header inside the child class.
Rules:
1. There should inheritance between classes.
2.Method header should be same (access modifiers return type method
name parameters).
3. we can't ovveride the private methods because private methods
don't participate in inheritance.
4. constructors can't be ovverriden because they also don't
participate in inheritance
5.we can only increase the visibility of a method inside the child class
but we can't decrease it for example if a method is declared
protected or default we can change it to public, but we can't
do the reverse.
6. we can't ovveride static methods, we say we have declared the static method
